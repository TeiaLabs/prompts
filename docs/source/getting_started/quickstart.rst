Quickstart
==========

This quickstart tutorial requires the library to be installed.
If you haven't already, please follow the :doc:`installation` guide.

In this quickstart, we'll walk through the basics of using the library to create a simple LLM text completion prompt.
We'll show you how to:

* Create artifacts, which serve as the building blocks of your prompt
* Show examples of Jinja templating features, which can help you create complex prompt behaviors
* Create a prompt, which will reference a collection of artifacts
* Render a prompt based on its artifacts and custom variable inputs
* Call a model provider to obtain a text completion answer based on our prompt
